Typescene Website
=================

This is an early version of the public website for Typescene. It has been hand-coded in HTML for simplicity. It may make sense to move this site to use Jekyll. Also, the "Docs index" page at github.io could be moved here instead and have the page over there redirect to the main Typescene domain.

Then again, perhaps the whole site should be re-done after a while based on lessons learnt about what users want to know, and include more samples/case studies.
