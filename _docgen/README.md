These files contain additional content that is appended to the JSDoc content from TypeScript definition files.

Make sure sections are separated using a line (`---`) followed by a level 1 heading on a new line, which refers to an ID (symbol from the API definition). Sections without a heading are not included in the output.

Add content to the top of any page (before any JSDoc sections) using the `:top` suffix (e.g. `ManagedList:top`), and add a 'page intro' text (large font just below the page heading) using the `:pageintro` suffix.
