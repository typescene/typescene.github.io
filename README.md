Typescene Website
=================

This is an early version of the public website for Typescene. It has been hand-coded in HTML for simplicity. It may make sense to move this site to use Jekyll. Also, the "Docs index" page in the source repo could be moved here instead.

Then again, perhaps the whole site should be re-done after a while based on lessons learnt about what users want to know, and include more samples/case studies.
