__Source code:__ The code for this example project is available on GitHub: [typescene/first-project](https://github.com/typescene/first-project){:target="_blank"}.

__View online:__ The final output can be seen in action [here](/first-project){:target="_blank"}.

### Setup {#setup}

Before getting started with Typescene, make sure you're familiar with JavaScript. Knowledge of TypeScript would also be very useful, especially to understand the reference documentation and autocomplete options, although you could definitely use Typescene with 'plain' modern JavaScript if you don't want to use TypeScript for your own code. To learn Typescript, start with the 5-minute tutorial on the documentation [website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html){:target="_blank"}.

Make sure NodeJS is installed on your computer, and the `npm` command has been added to your `PATH`. To test this, enter `npm -v` in a terminal window, which should show you the current version of NPM.

Source files can be edited using any editor that can save plain text files, but an IDE or editor that is optimized for TypeScript can speed up your workflow a lot. [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com){:target="_blank"} is an excellent choice.

#### Creating a package

Let's create a folder to hold our project files, and use NPM to initialize our project. This creates a default `project.json` file, which we'll fine-tune later on. We'll also install the Typescene Web app package.

```bash
mkdir first-project
cd first-project
npm init -y
npm install @typescene/webapp
```

#### Copying starter files

The `@typescene/webapp` package includes source files that can be used for getting started with a new project, for both Webpack and Parcel bundlers. We'll need to copy those, as well as the content of the `package.json` file.

Run the following command to copy the starter files for use with Webpack, which is what we're going to use here. Don't forget to include the dot at the end.

```bash
npx ncp ./node_modules/@typescene/webapp/setup/minimal-webpack .
```

Take a look at the `SETUP.md` file (copied along with the source files) in your text editor of choice.  This file includes a suggestion for the contents of `package.json`. The following properties are important, so make sure to copy those to the `package.json` file in your own package folder (and remove the default 'scripts' property that was generated by `npm init`):

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "webpack-dev-server --hot --config src/webpack.config.js",
  "build": "webpack -p --config src/webpack.config.js"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "typescript": "^3.4.5",
  "webpack": "^4.31.0",
  "webpack-cli": "^3.3.2",
  "webpack-dev-server": "^3.3.1",
  "copy-webpack-plugin": "^5.0.3",
  "ts-loader": "^6.0.0"
}
```

> __Note:__ if you're not intending to use TypeScript for your own code, you can leave out the `typescript` and `ts-loader` dependencies. These are only used by Webpack to compile TypeScript code on the fly.

Then return to your terminal and instruct NPM to install all of the new dependencies added to `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Testing your setup

To test the 'minimal' app you've just copied to your project folder, start the Webpack development server from your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Webpack should inform you that its server is now running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/){:target="_blank"}, and that it has compiled your app along with its own dev-server and hot module replacement code. Opening this address in your browser should show a simple 'Hello, world!' message in the middle of the page.

### 'Todo' Service and model {#service}

Let's build a simple 'todo' app that lets you enter tasks, mark them as done, and remove them. At a high level, we're going to create the following components:

* A service that keeps track of the data model,
* An activity that displays the 'main' screen of the app,
* A view for the main screen.

We'll start with the service. Since the minimal sample code we copied didn't include any services, we'll need to add a folder to our project. It's good practice to keep services together in a separate `services` folder, away from activities and views, since services are often used across multiple activities anyway.

To represent our todo items, we'll extend the [`ManagedRecord`](/docs/ref/ManagedRecord) class. Instances of this class can be kept in a [`ManagedList`](/docs/ref/ManagedList) object which is in turn referenced from the `TodoService` itself, as *managed child* objects. This way, we can simply 'destroy' our todo items to get them removed from the list.

Create the `src/services/TodoService.ts` file in your project (or use `.js` if you don't want to use TypeScript), and add the following code:

```typescript
import { CHANGE, managedChild, ManagedList,
  ManagedRecord, ManagedService } from "typescene";

/** Represents a single to-do item */
export class TodoItem extends ManagedRecord {
  constructor(public text: string) {
    super();
  }
  complete?: boolean;
}

export class TodoService extends ManagedService {
  name = "App.Todo";

  /** Current list of todo items */
  @managedChild
  readonly items = new ManagedList()
    .restrict(TodoItem)
    .propagateEvents();

  nRemaining = 0;
  nCompleted = 0;

  addItem(text: string) {
    if (text) this.items.add(new TodoItem(text));
  }

  removeCompleted() {
    this.items.forEach(it => {
      if (it.complete) this.items.remove(it);
    });
  }
}
TodoService.observe(class {
  constructor(public readonly svc: TodoService) { }

  // called when (any of) the items change(s):
  onItemsChangeAsync() {
    let nCompleted = this.svc.items
      .pluck("complete")
      .filter(b => b).length;
    let total = this.svc.items.count;
    this.svc.nCompleted = nCompleted;
    this.svc.nRemaining = total - nCompleted;
    this.svc.emit(CHANGE);
  }
})

```

Note that we're exposing the `items` property as a public property on the `TodoService` directly. Usually in object-oriented programming we'll only want to expose functionality through getters and setters, *however* since we're restricting the list to instances of `TodoItem` anyway, this is relatively safe and it saves us from having to create methods for all of the list operations, while still being able to watch for changes and guarantee consistency.

Now we need to make sure that we can actually use this service from our activity. We'll *register* an instance of this class in the main file for our app — add the following lines to `src/app.ts`:

```typescript
import { TodoService } from "./services/TodoService";
new TodoService().register();
```

### Main Activity {#activity}

Typescene applications are really just collections of *activities*, which are activated and deactivated as the user navigates around the app. Activities represent the overall application state, and contain most of the logic that runs in response to user actions. In the case of our 'todo' app, we'll only need one activity.

The code for a `MainActivity` class is already included in the minimal code we copied from the Web app package, but that doesn't do much at all.

Find the `src/activities/main/activity.ts` file, and remove the code for the `onManagedStateActiveAsync` method, since we don't need this handler for now. Add the following lines instead:

```typescript
@service("App.Todo")
todo?: TodoService;
```

> __Note:__ The code above requires the symbols `service` and `TodoService` to be imported at the top of the file. If you're using Visual Studio Code, a lightbulb shows up when you select these IDs — click the icon and you'll find an option to add imports automatically. Alternatively, read on for a full listing of the finished activity source file.

This seems like a lot of code to refer to the `TodoService` we created earlier, but every part has its own purpose here:

1. The [`@service`](/docs/ref/service) decorator turns the ordinary `todo` property into a *service property*, which keeps the property value up to date as services are registered, destroyed, or replaced.
2. `"App.Todo"` is the exact name of the service that we're looking for, provided to the decorator as a string parameter.
3. `todo` is the property name that we're adding to the activity class.
4. `?: TodoService` is a TypeScript type annotation that tells the compiler that our `todo` property refers to an instance of our `TodoService` class *or* may be set to undefined (since we're not actually setting the property directly; however in practice the service is already registered when the activity is created, so the property has a value all the time).

To accept entry of new tasks using a text field without having to listen for changes to the text field itself, we'll use a *form context controller* in our UI. The controller binds to a managed object on the activity, and provides a reference to this 'form context' to all child components. Let's create the form context and store it in a `formInput` property:

```typescript
@managedChild
formInput = ManagedRecord.create({
  newTask: ""
});
```

Furthermore, the activity needs to be able to handle events that come in from the view. Let’s add some handler methods for adding a task, removing all completed tasks, and toggling the state of a task (which listens for a [`UIListCellAdapterEvent`](/docs/ref/UIListCellAdapterEvent), a special type of event that’s emitted by a list item cell and includes a reference to the list item’s *object* — the managed object that’s represented by the cell that generated the original event).

Here's the final version of our `src/activities/main/activity.ts` file:

```typescript
import { CHANGE, managedChild, ManagedRecord,
  PageViewActivity, service,
  UIListCellAdapterEvent } from "typescene";
import { TodoItem, TodoService } from "../../services/TodoService";
import view from "./view";

export class MainActivity
  extends PageViewActivity.with(view) {
  path = "/";

  @service("App.Todo")
  todo?: TodoService;

  /** Form context for the 'add a task' text field */
  @managedChild
  formInput = ManagedRecord.create({
    newTask: ""
  });

  // event handlers:

  addTask() {
    this.todo!.addItem(this.formInput.newTask);
    this.formInput.newTask = "";
    this.formInput.emit(CHANGE);
  }

  toggleTask(e: UIListCellAdapterEvent<TodoItem>) {
    if (e.object instanceof TodoItem) {
      e.object.complete = !e.object.complete;
      e.object.emit(CHANGE);
    }
  }

  removeCompleted() {
    this.todo!.removeCompleted();
  }
}
```

### View {#view}

Now that we have a service to store our data, and an activity to make it available, we can create a view to display it.

> __TODO:__ Add descriptions here for some of the below code.

Here's the final version of our `src/activities/main/view/index.ts` file:

```typescript
import { HMR } from "@typescene/webapp";

  UICenterRow, UIExpandedLabel, UIFlowCell,

  UILinkButton, UIListCellAdapter, UIListController,
  UIRow, UIScrollContainer, UISeparator, UISpacer, UIStyle,
  UIStyleController, UIToggle } from "typescene";

export default HMR.enableViewReload(
  module,
  UIScrollContainer.with(
    UIFlowCell.with(

          onToggleTask: "toggleTask()"
        },

        // list item template:
        UIListCellAdapter.with(
          { padding: { x: 16, y: 8 } },
          UIRow.with(
            { revealTransition: "down-fast" },
            UIToggle.with({

              onChange: "+ToggleTask"
            }),
            UIStyleController.with(

                state: bind("object.complete"),
                styles: {
                  true: UIStyle.create({
                    textStyle: { strikeThrough: true }
                  })
                }
              },
              UIExpandedLabel.with({
                text: bind("object.text"),
                onClick: "+ToggleTask"
              })
            )
          )
        ),

        // list container:
        UIFlowCell.with({
          separator: { type: "line" },
          animatedContentRenderingDuration: 200
        })
      ),

      // --------------------------------------
      // footer, if non-empty
      UIFlowCell.with(
